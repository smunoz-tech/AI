### Google promting essential

I take this course to improve my prompting skill for my every day JOB

## 5-step prompt framework

a good promt follow a simple framework(maybe?)

TCREI (Tecrei en espa√±ol)

T = Task (Tarea, Accion, Objetivo)
C = Context (Contexto)
R = References (Referencia)
E = Evaluate (Evaluar)
I = Iterate (Iterar, Repetir)

First is task.
You need to describe the task you want the generative AI
tool to help you with.
Now, this should include a persona
and a format preference, so that the task is specific.
Persona refers to
what expertise you want the gen AI tool to draw from.
You can ask the tool to take on a persona like a
professional speech writer
or a marketing executive with 15 years of experience.
Or you can ask it to create output for a specific audience,
a customer, or even your manager.
You can be as detailed as you'd like when adding a persona
to your task. Format refers to how you want the output
to appear, whether that's a bulleted list,
short sentences, or a table.
So there you have it task.
Next, you'll include context
or the necessary details to help the gen AI tool understand
what you need from it.
This is the difference between writing.
Give me some ideas for a birthday present under $30
and give me five ideas for a birthday present.
My budget is $30.
The gift is for a 29-year-old who loves winter sports
and has recently switched from snowboarding to skiing.
Sometimes you'll add references for the gen AI tool
to use while creating its output.
You just asked a gen AI tool to give you ideas
for a birthday present, right?
Well, if you add examples
of birthday presents you've given in the past as references,
the gen AI tool can give you a more useful output.
There aren't always going to be clear references of
what you need, especially if you're working on something
more abstract or searching for ideas and inspiration.
Once you have your output, it's time to evaluate.
Ask yourself if the input you
provided gave you the output you needed.
This leads us to the final part of the framework. Iterate.
If you evaluate your output
and determine that you're not getting what you need,
you can try again by adding more information
or tweaking your prompt.
And this is a key part of prompting effectively,
and we'll explore it in depth later on in the course.
One more note on the framework.
There are plenty of ways to construct an effective prompt.
The order of how you construct a prompt is less important
than this substance of the prompt itself.
As long as you're thoughtfully creating, really, excellent
inputs, your outputs should be great. 


Prompt example:

``` bad idea of prompt
Give me some ideas for a birthday present under $30.
```

``` God idea of prompt
Give me 5 ideas for a birthday present. My budget is $30. The gift is for a 29-years-old who loves winter sports and has recently swithced from snowboarding to skiing.
```



- **Task**: es la tarea que va realizar la IA y se dividie en dos:
    - Persona: here you will let the AI take a person rol (ex, be a techer or be developer or be shopping buddy or a normal person) 
    - Format: is goint to be the output, to who is this concent that you are creating for, ex maybe a manager, older people, maybe a json or yaml file for a program.
- **Context**: give the details of what is need, more detail seems to be better (but I have to try on that, when more is enough?)
- **References**: for the example of the gift present.. tyou can add refrences from previus gifts, so it knows more about you and also the present doesn't repeat.
- **Evaluate**: Evaluate first by reading the prompt an check if all that is there is need to complete the task, or if you need to add something else.
Second if you run the prompt and the answer is not what you expecet... Well that is why the *Iterate* step comes handy.
- **Iterate**: if the otput is not what expected or need more information or less, you re-evaluate your prompt and rewirte to make it run as you need it.


And if the prompt is good and fill all your needs save it, as future refrences
